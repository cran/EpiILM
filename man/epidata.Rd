\arguments{
  \item{type}{
 Type of compartment framework, with the choice of "SI" for
Susceptible-Infectious diseases and "SIR" for
Susceptible-Infectious-Removed.
}
  \item{n}{
Population size
}
  \item{tmin}{
The time point at which simulation begins, default value is one.
}
  \item{tmax}{
The last time point of simulation.
}
\item{sus.par}{
Susceptibility parameter (\eqn{>0}).
}
\item{trans.par}{
Transmissibility parameter (\eqn{>0}).
}
  \item{beta}{
Spatial parameter(s) (\eqn{>0}) or network parameter (s) (\eqn{>0}) if contact network is used.
}

\item{spark}{
Sparks parameter (\eqn{>=0}), representing infections unexplained by other parts
of the model (eg. infections coming in from outside the observed population), default value is zero.
}

\item{Sformula}{
An object of class formula. See \link{formula}.

Individual-level covariate information associated with susceptibility can be passed 
through this argument. An expression of the form \code{ ~ model} is interpreted as 
a specification that the susceptibility function, \eqn{\Omega_{S}(i)}  is modelled by 
a linear predictor specified symbolically by the model term. Such a model consists of 
a series of terms separated by \code{+} and \code{-} operators. If there is no susceptibility 
covariate information, \code{Sformula} is null.

}
\item{Tformula}{
An object of class formula. See \link{formula}.

Individual-level covariate information associated with transmissibility can be passed 
through this argument. An expression of the form \code{ ~ -1+model} is interpreted as 
a specification that the transmissibility function, \eqn{\Omega_{T}(j) }  is modelled by 
a linear predictor specified symbolically by the model terms without the incorporation of 
the intercept term. Such a model consists of a series of terms separated by \code{+} and \code{-} operators. 
If there is no transmissibility covariate information, \code{Tformula} is null.

}
  \item{x}{
 X coordinates of individuals.
}
  \item{y}{
Y coordinates of individuals.
}
  \item{inftime}{
Times at which individuals are infected to initialize epidemic simulation.
}
  \item{infperiod}{
Length of infectious period for each individual.
}
  \item{contact}{
  A contact network matrix or an array of contact network matrices.
}

\details{
We consider following two individual level models:

{\bold{Spatial model:}}

\deqn{P(i,t) = 1- \exp\{-\Omega_{S}(i) \sum_{j \in I(t)}{{\Omega_{T}(j)d_{ij}}^{-\beta}} - \varepsilon\}}

{\bold{Network model:}}

\deqn{P(i,t) = 1- \exp\{-\Omega_{S}(i) \sum_{j \in I(t)}{\Omega_{T}(j)(\beta_{1} C^{(1)}_{ij} + \dots + \beta_{n}  C^{(n)}_{ij} )}- \varepsilon\}}

where \eqn{P(i,t)} is the probability that susceptible individual i is infected at time point t, 
becoming infectious at time t+1;\eqn{\Omega_{S}(i)} is a susceptibility function which accommodates 
potential risk factors associated with susceptible individual i contracting the disease; 
\eqn{\Omega_{T}(j)} is  a transmissibility function which accommodates potential risk factors 
associated with infectious individual j; \eqn{\varepsilon} is a sparks term which represents 
infections originating from outside the population being observed or some other unobserved infection mechanism. 

The susceptibility function can incorporate any individual-level covariates  of interest and 
\eqn{\Omega_{S}(i)} is treated as a linear function of the covariates, i.e., 
\eqn{\Omega_{S}(i) = \alpha_{0} + \alpha_1 X_{1}(i) + \alpha_{2} X_{2} (i) + \dots  + \alpha_{n_{s}} X_{n_{s}} (i)}, 
where \eqn{X_{1}(i), \dots, X_{n_{s}} (i)} denote \eqn{n_{s}} covariates associated with 
susceptible individual \eqn{i}, along with susceptibility parameters \eqn{\alpha_{0},\dots,\alpha_{n_s} >0}. 
If the model does not contain any susceptibility covariates then  \eqn{\Omega_{S}(i) = \alpha_{0}} is used. 
In a similar way, the transmissibility function can incorporate any individual-level covariates of interest 
associated with infectious individual. \eqn{\Omega_{T}(j)} is also treated as a linear function of the covariates, 
but without the intercept term, i.e., \eqn{\Omega_{T}(j) = \phi_{1} X_{1}(j) + \phi_{2} X_{2} (j) + \dots  + \phi_{n_{t}} X_{n_{t}} (j)}, 
where \eqn{X_{1}(j), \dots, X_{n_{t}} (j)} denote  the \eqn{n_{t}} covariates associated with  infectious 
individual j, along with transmissibility parameters \eqn{\phi_{1},\dots,\phi_{n_{t}} >0}. If the model 
does not contain any transmissibility covariates then  \eqn{\Omega_{T}(j)  = 1} is used.
