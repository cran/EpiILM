\arguments{
  \item{type}{

Susceptible-Infectious diseases and "SIR" for
Susceptible-Infectious-Removed.
}
  \item{n}{
Population size
}
  \item{tmin}{
The time point at which simulation begins, default value is one.
}

The last time point of simulation.
}
\item{sus.par}{
Susceptibility parameter (>0).
}
\item{trans.par}{
Transmissibility parameter (>0).
}
  \item{beta}{
Spatial parameter(s) (>0) or network parameter (s) (>0) if contact network is used.
}

\item{spark}{
Sparks parameter (>=0), representing infections unexplained by other partsof the model (eg. infections coming in from outside the observed population), default value is zero.
}

\item{Sformula}{
An object of class formula. See \link{formula}.

Individual-level covariate information associated with susceptibility can be passed through this argument. An expression of the form \code{ ~ model} is interpreted as a specification that the susceptibility function, \eqn{\Omega_S(i) }  is modelled by a linear predictor specified symbolically by the model term. Such a model consists of a series of terms separated by \code{+} and \code{-} operators. If there is no susceptibility covariate information, \code{Sformula} is null.

}
\item{Tformula}{
An object of class formula. See \link{formula}.

Individual-level covariate information associated with transmissibility can be passed through this argument. An expression of the form \code{ ~ -1+model} is interpreted as a specification that the transmissibility function, \eqn{\Omega_T(j) }  is modelled by a linear predictor specified symbolically by the model terms without the incorporation of the intercept term. Such a model consists of a series of terms separated by \code{+} and \code{-} operators. If there is no transmissibility covariate information, \code{Tformula} is null.

}
  \item{x}{
 X coordinates of individuals.
}
  \item{y}{
Y coordinates of individuals.
}
  \item{inftime}{
Times at which individuals are infected to initialize epidemic simulation.
}
  \item{infperiod}{
Length of infectious period for each individual.
}
  \item{contact}{
  A contact network matrix or an array of contact network matrices.

\details{
We consider following two individual level models:

{\bold{Spatial model:}}

\deqn{P(i,t) =1- \exp\{-\Omega_S(i) \sum_{j \in I(t)}{\Omega_T(j)d_{ij}^{-\beta}- \varepsilon}\}}

{\bold{Network model:}}

\deqn{P(i,t) =1- \exp\{-\Omega_S(i) \sum_{j \in I(t)}{\Omega_T(j)(\beta_1 C^{(1)}_{ij}} + \dots + \beta_n  C^{(n)}_{ij} )- \varepsilon\}}

where \eqn{P(i,t)} is the probability that susceptible individual i is infected at time point t, becoming infectious at time t+1; 
\eqn{\Omega_S(i)} is  a susceptibility function which accommodates potential risk factors associated with susceptible individual i contracting the disease; \eqn{\Omega_T(j)} is  a transmissibility function which accommodates potential risk factors associated with infectious individual j; \eqn{\varepsilon} is a sparks term which represents infections originating from outside the population being observed or some other unobserved infection mechanism. 

The susceptibility function can incorporate any individual-level covariates  of interest and \eqn{\Omega_S(i)} is treated as a linear function of the covariates, i.e., \eqn{\Omega_S(i) = \alpha_0 + \alpha_1 X_1(i) + \alpha_2 X_2 (i) + \dots  + 
\alpha_{n_s} X_{n_s} (i)}, where \eqn{X_1(i), \dots, X_{n_s} (i)} denote  \eqn{n_s}covariates associated with susceptible individual $i$, along with susceptibility parameters \eqn{\alpha_0,\dots,\alpha_{n_s} >0}. If the model does not contain any susceptibility covariates then  \eqn{\Omega_S(i) = \alpha_0} is used. In a similar way, the transmissibility function can incorporate any individual-level covariates of interest associated with infectious individual. \eqn{\Omega_T(j)} is also treated as a linear function of the covariates, but without the intercept term, i.e., \eqn{\Omega_T(j) = \phi_1 X_1(j) + \phi_2 X_2 (j) + \dots  + \phi_{n_t} X_{n_t} (j)}, where \eqn{X_1(j), \dots, X_{n_t} (j)} denote  the \eqn{n_t} covariates associated with  infectious individual j, along with transmissibility parameters \eqn{\phi_1,\dots,\phi_{n_t} >0}. If the model does not contain any transmissibility covariates then  \eqn{\Omega_T(j)  = 1} is used.
